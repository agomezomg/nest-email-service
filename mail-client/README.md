# Mail Client

This part of the application is VERY incomplete!! It was my introduction to Tailwind and using React to subscribe to Websockets. I would normally use a template from much more talented frontend developers than myself (Frontend work is hard and I have no problem admitting that), but I wanted to take the opportunity to try out Tailwind (with Flowbite).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
